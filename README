This repository contains the ruby branch of Ninject.
The aim is to integrate the DLR as nicely as possible in a DI container.

If you're using Resharper for running unit tests you'll have to uncheck the box next to
Shadow-copies being tested in the unit testing section of the resharper options.

example:
to_configure_ninject do |ninject|
  ninject.bind IServiceA, :to => ServiceA, :as => :singleton, :meta => { :type => "superservice" }, :name => "aaaaa"
end

Happy playing :)
